    "# SUPERVISED LEARING \n",
    "# Here we have the following Project Description\n",
    "* The data are MC generated (see below) to simulate registration of high energy gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using the imaging technique. Cherenkov gamma telescope observes high energy gamma rays, taking advantage of the radiation emitted by charged particles produced inside the electromagnetic showers initiated by the gammas, and developing in the atmosphere. This Cherenkov radiation (of visible to UV wavelengths) leaks through the atmosphere and gets recorded in the detector, allowing reconstruction of the shower parameters. The available information consists of pulses left by the incoming Cherenkov photons on the photomultiplier tubes, arranged in a plane, the camera. Depending on the energy of the primary gamma, a total of few hundreds to some 10000 Cherenkov photons get collected, in patterns (called the shower image), allowing to discriminate statistically those caused by primary gammas (signal) from the images of hadronic showers initiated by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere (background).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Typically, the image of a shower after some pre-processing is an elongated cluster. Its long axis is oriented towards the camera center if the shower axis is parallel to the telescope's optical axis, i.e. if the telescope axis is directed towards a point source. A principal component analysis is performed in the camera plane, which results in a correlation axis and defines an ellipse. If the depositions were distributed as a bivariate Gaussian, this would be an equidensity ellipse. The characteristic parameters of this ellipse (often called Hillas parameters) are among the image parameters that can be used for discrimination. The energy depositions are typically asymmetric along the major axis, and this asymmetry can also be used in discrimination. There are, in addition, further discriminating characteristics, like the extent of the cluster in the image plane, or the total sum of depositions.\n"

    "\n",
    "In the process of building and evaluating a machine learning model, the dataset is typically divided into three distinct subsets: **Training**, **Validation**, and **Testing**. These subsets serve different purposes to ensure the model is both accurate and generalizes well to unseen data. Below is an explanation of each subset and its purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. **Training Data**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: The training data is used to **train** the machine learning model. During this phase, the model learns the underlying patterns, relationships, and features in the dataset.\n",
    "- **How it's used**: The model is optimized using the training data through methods like gradient descent. The model’s weights and biases are updated to minimize the loss function during this phase.\n",
    "- **Proportion of dataset**: The training set typically represents the largest portion of the data, around 70-80% of the total dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **Validation Data**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: The validation data is used to tune the model’s **hyperparameters** and evaluate its performance **during** training. It helps in preventing overfitting by providing an unbiased evaluation while the model is still being trained.\n",
    "- **How it's used**: After each training epoch, the model is evaluated on the validation set. This helps in adjusting hyperparameters like learning rate, regularization, and deciding when to stop training (early stopping).\n",
    "- **Proportion of dataset**: The validation set typically represents about 10-15% of the total dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **Test Data**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: The test data is used to evaluate the **final performance** of the model after it has been trained and validated. This dataset helps assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data.\n",
    "- **How it's used**: After the model has completed training and tuning, it is tested on this set to measure its performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or other relevant metrics.\n",
    "- **Proportion of dataset**: The test set typically makes up about 10-15% of the total dataset.\n",
