# Machine Learning Overview

Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. ML analyzes large datasets (training data) to identify patterns, relationships, and make predictions or decisions based on new, unseen data. Over time, machine learning algorithms improve their performance as they are exposed to more data.

## Types of Machine Learning

There are five primary types of machine learning, each with its own approach and applications:

### 1. Supervised Learning
Supervised learning involves training a model using labeled data, where each data point has a corresponding label (desired output). The model learns the mapping between inputs and outputs based on this labeled data.

**Common Applications:**
- Spam filtering
- Image recognition
- Sentiment analysis
- Stock market prediction

**Examples of Algorithms:**
- Linear regression
- Logistic regression
- Decision trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
- K-nearest neighbors (KNN)
- Random forests

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data, where data points lack predefined labels. The goal is to identify hidden patterns or structures in the data, such as clustering similar data points or reducing the data's dimensionality.

**Common Applications:**
- Customer segmentation
- Anomaly detection
- Recommendation systems
- Market research

**Examples of Algorithms:**
- K-means clustering
- Hierarchical clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

### 3. Semi-Supervised Learning
Semi-supervised learning combines both labeled and unlabeled data for training. It uses the limited labeled data to guide learning from a much larger set of unlabeled data.

**Common Applications:**
- Text classification
- Image segmentation
- Sentiment analysis

**Examples of Algorithms:**
- Self-training
- Co-training
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

### 4. Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning enables models to learn through trial and error by interacting with an environment. The model receives rewards or penalties based on its actions, which helps it adjust its behavior over time to maximize cumulative rewards.

**Common Applications:**
- Robotics control
- Game playing (e.g., AlphaGo)
- Resource management

**Examples of Algorithms:**
- Q-learning
- SARSA
- Deep Q-Networks (DQNs)

### 5. Self-Supervised Learning
Self-supervised learning generates artificial labels or supervisory signals from unlabeled data itself. It explores relationships within the data to learn representations that can be applied to a variety of tasks.

**Common Applications:**
- Image and text representation learning
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks

**Examples of Algorithms:**
- Contrastive learning
- Autoencoders
- Masked language modeling
